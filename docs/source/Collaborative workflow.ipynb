    "The **Collaborative Workflow** allows volunteers to build upon each other’s classifications in a shared, iterative process.\n",
    "Rather than starting from scratch, each volunteer sees the **previous volunteer’s freehand drawing** and can **edit** it directly.\n",
    "This approach enables more accurate and consistent annotations for complex or subjective tasks such as freehand polygon drawing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a standard Zooniverse workflow, each volunteer’s classification is treated independently.\n",
    "However, in the collaborative setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **latest** classification is passed forward as the starting point for the next volunteer.\n",
    "- Volunteers can then edit existing annotations.\n",

If not, check out the [Polygon data - extraction and reduction.ipynb](https://github.com/zooniverse/aggregation-for-caesar/blob/master/docs/source/Polygon%20data%20-%20extraction%20and%20reduction.ipynb) guide.\n",

    "3. **Front-End Configuration** — enables the workflow to fetch and display the most recent classifications from Caesar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these steps is detailed below. Once configured correctly, volunteers will see the **previous classification** when opening a new subject and edits made by each volunteer will be saved and passed to the next.\n",

    "# Step 1 — Configure the Reducer for Collaborative Classifications\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to configure the reducer, which must include the following key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "average_type: last\n",
    "collab: True\n",
    "```\n",

    "- **`average_type: last`**\n",
    "  Ensures that the current classification uses only the **most recent (last)** classification made by a previous volunteer, rather than computing an average across all classifications.\n",
    "  This is critical for a collaborative workflow where each participant builds upon or edits the last version.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`collab: True`**\n",
    "  Enables collaborative mode.\n",
    "  When `collab` is set to `True`, the system will:\n",
    "  - Display the previous volunteer’s freehand classification to the current volunteer.\n",
    "  - Allow the current volunteer to **edit** that freehand drawing directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following keyword arguments (`kwargs`) are **required by the front end**, but will **default automatically** if not specified:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter   | Default Value   | Description |\n",
    "|--------------|----------------|--------------|\n",
    "| `stepKey`    | `'S0'`          | The classification step key. |\n",
    "| `taskIndex`  | `0`             | Index of the task in the workflow. |\n",
    "| `toolType`   | `'freehandLine'` | The drawing tool type used for freehand classifications. |\n",

    "# Step 2 — Database Setup on Caesar\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the reducer has been configured for collaborative classifications, the next step is to set up the extractor and reducer on [Caesar](https://caesar.zooniverse.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extractor Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The extractor defines how classification data is pulled from the Zooniverse workflow. On Caesar, navigate to Workflows, then your project. Under the Extractors tab, select Create Extractor -> External:\n",
    "\n",
    "![extractor_setup](./_static/extractor_setup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to fill out the fields. The minimum workflow version number can be found from the Zooniverse front end. On the project builder, navigate to the Workflows tab and select the workflow you're setting up the collaborative workflow for. The version is shown in the second section:\n",

    "![workflow_version](./_static/workflow_version.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the workflow version is 4.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to construct the URL. You can build the extractor URL using Python’s `urllib.parse` library. For our example above, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import urllib.parse\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert any other parameters that aren't default values\n",

    "print(urllib.parse.urlencode(config))\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Reducer Setup\n",
