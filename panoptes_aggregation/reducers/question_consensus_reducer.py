    Parameters
    ----------
    data_list : list
        A list of extractions created by
        :meth:`panoptes_aggregation.extractors.question_extractor.question_extractor`
    pairs : bool, optional
        Default `False`. How multiple choice questions are treated.
        When `True` the set of all choices is treated as a single answer

    Returns
    -------
    reduction : dict
        A dictinary with the following keys

        * `most_likely` : `key` with greatest number of classifications/votes
        * `num_votes` : vote count for mostly likely `key`
        * `agreement` : fraction of total votes held by most likely `key`.
